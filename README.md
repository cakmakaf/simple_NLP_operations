# simple_NLP_operations


In this project, we apply some simple NLP operations for a given random script. The text file has been gatherd from the website
of http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/. The operations are detecting the frequency of each word in the tex and obtaining the 
frequency of a user input word if it exist in the text. 

First, we read the script file and eliminate all punctuation marks between words. Then we defined a word detector function to 
find each word and put it in a location list to be able to find the individual frequencies. 

Following, we defined the distribution function to be able to determine the number of the frequencies of the words. 

The program has 3 outcomes once we run it. You could find the frequency of each word in the text or you may enter a word from the 
text and then obtain the number of the frequency of that particular sample word. Or you may quit from the program. 

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor.
